# Softemplate

I found myself making small apps from time to time, and some basic setup is something i mostly do the same way. 
Login, register, search, and few links. So i made it. Use it if it fits you.

## What is in the template
Login / register form -> Login leads to main page -> just provide anything in inputs and press logn.
register button doesn do anything.
